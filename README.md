Project Title: Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning  


Project Role: 
Contributor (Project Idea Originator)


Project Type: 
Group Project (3 members) 


Tools & Techniques: 
CatBoost, XGBoost Regressor, Random Forest, SMOTE, Hyperparameter Tuning, IBM-HR Dataset.


Description:
Enhanced a base model project that analyzed employee attrition using machine learning algorithms. 
Improved the performance by balancing the dataset with SMOTE and introducing new algorithms, including CatBoost and XGBoost Regressor. 
Further optimized the best performing algorithm through hyperparameter tuning. 
This project aimed to help organizations mitigate employee attrition by identifying at-risk employees and suggesting actionable strategies such as improving facilities, offering better pay, and enhancing work-life balance.
